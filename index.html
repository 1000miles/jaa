            Organizations like Rails Girls have done a great job of helping
            beginners discover the world of coding. But once you get there, then
            what?
          </p>

          <p>
            Many people leave tech because they are discouraged by the atmosphere,
            lack of support etc... Unfortunately, we've found that many people don't
            talk about this until AFTER they've left.
          </p>

          <p>
            Juniors Are Awesome (JAA) aims to be a safe and confidential space where
            junior developers & newbies can find support, ask for help, and
            find mentors among OTHER juniors. Because who knows better what you're going
            through than someone who is in the same position?
