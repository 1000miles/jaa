#Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this community, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming space, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through sharing their experiences, listening to others, offering suggestions, reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Community maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, community maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Community maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:
* opening an [issue on Github](https://github.com/rubycorns/jaa/issues) 
* contacting a community member via slack ("mc" for Sara or "tam" for Tam) provided you are a member of the slack channel
* or via email (us@juniorsareawesome.org).

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant version 1.2.0](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/).
